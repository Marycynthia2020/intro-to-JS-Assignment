6. Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category
Dynamically-typed languages perform type checking at runtime. This means that scripts written in dynamically-typed languages can compile even if they contain errors that will prevent the script from running properly. Examples include: JavaScript, Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP.
Statically typed languages perform type checking at compile time. If a script written in a statically-typed language contains errors, it will fail to compile until the errors have been fixed. Statically-typed languages require you to declare the data types of your variables before you use them.  Examples include: Java, C, C++.

7. Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined&nbsp
Null is the intentional absence of the value. it is an assigned value meaning nothing. Eg. const  test1 = null;
console.log(test1); // null
Undefined means a variable has been declared but not defined yet. Eg. const test2;
console.log(test2); //undefined
